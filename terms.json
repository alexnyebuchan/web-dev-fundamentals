    "title": "CDN",
    "definition": "A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers located around the world. It caches and serves copies of data, including images and other content, from the origin server to various geographic locations.

    "title": "XSS",
    "definition": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability in web applications where attackers attempt to inject malicious code, often in the form of JavaScript, into the application. If the application fails to properly sanitize or validate user inputs, these injected scripts can execute in the browsers of other users accessing the affected page. This can lead to various malicious actions such as redirecting users to harmful websites, stealing sensitive information like session cookies, or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

    "title": "FTP",
    "definition": "FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a set of rules  for how files should be shared over a network between client and server. It defines how users upload, download and manage files on remote servers. FTP has been replaced often by other protocols such as SFTP or FTPS, as the data is not encrypted and therefore less secure. However, where security is less of an issue, FTP is still used - for instance in legacy systems. "

In web development, this may be Stripe's javascript functions or API's, for a purpose like handling payments. Though it could include other resourses like libraries, sample code and more. The predefined nature of the tools speeds up development as you don't have to write all the code yourself. "

  {
    "title": "TDD",
    "definition": "Test Driven Development is a software development approach where tests are written before writing the code. This is to drive the design and development of the code through testing. First a test is written, then observed to fail, before code is written to pass the test. Once the code passes it is refactored and then the cycle repeats."
  },
  {
    "title": "BDD",
    "definition": "Behaviour Driven Development is a software development approach that encourages collaboration between developers, quality assurance and non-technical business stakeholders. It defines what a system should do based on scenarios and examples written in a natural language called Gherkin syntax. This aims to bridge the gap between the technical understanding of a developer and business goals and provide clarity. There are executible specifications contained within to ensure the system's behaviour meets the desired outcomes of all parties."
