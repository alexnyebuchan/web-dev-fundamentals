    "definition": "Making music is a great way to spend your time, no matter your state of employment. However, without a life outside of this, the music will probably be boring. What you channel into music is what makes it interesting."
  },
  {
    "definition": "I don’t care what age my friends are. Why would I hang out with someone my own age I don’t like, rather than someone younger or older that I do? I like a broad range of perspectives."

    "definition": "What's worse, having no status but not caring, or having status and desperately clinging to it - your self-worth dependent on other's approval?"

  },
  {
    "definition": "An unexamined life is to live by other people’s standards. Too much thinking is madness. Find a middle"

    "definition": "Don’t necessarily take the obvious choice -  go for what specifically you want."

  {
    "definition": "Frame Justifying: trying to mitigate or explain why your status is better than it looks, anxiously. A form of reframing. Eg. ‘I work in hospitality but I’m an Assistant General Manager with a salary.’ Eg. ‘I’m a rich kid but I’ve made my own way and had no help. Self made man.’ We try to cover up low status chips to our frame. This only comes across as insecure. Be honest and direct. ‘I have some wealth, I pursued my passion in my 20s. Who wouldn’t?’. No reframing."
  },
  {
    "definition": "Accolades and achievements are seductive for your self worth. It's tempting to fall back on these in hard times ‘well at least I did x, y or z’ - but why not have self worth for simply being? In the same way, why attach negative self esteem to bad past experiences ‘I fucked up a, b or c’. All of this is framing, what information may or may not make you look better, but inside you should have consistent self worth. Try to distance your own self worth from accoladdes and failures in the real world."

    "definition": "Is sex to you proving you are on a high, or higher rung of the ladder than either you are, or claim to be? Is sex an anxious peacock display of status and capitalist success - what kind of person will you attract if you beleive this?"
  },
  {
    "definition": "Productivity is not just economic. Self-anaylsing and reflecting, taking time in isolation to confront yourself and your fears, for instance, could yield high rewards such as improved self-worth from a small investment, like a walk in the park. Reclaim productivity"
  },
  {
    "definition": "To me, a loser is someone who lives by a set of values not their own, not taking risks, confronting themselves in order to grow and playing the victim. In order to know your values however, you may need to go through phases of being a “loser”, be tested, to realize what your values even are. It's ok to have a bumpy ride, we're all losers sometimes."

  {
    "definition": "Learning is a love of knowing. You could do this as a child, adult, or old person. Even if you had a year to live, if learning was what you wanted then do it, even if you never get to use it. It’s ok to just enjoy learning for it’s own sake."
  },
  {
    "definition": "If the raw animal inside of you believes something, the ‘shadow’ - and this belief does not contradict social norms - embody it immediately. Eg. “You can go to university at any age” - I believe that in my subconscious, and although it's unconventional, it's not ostracising as a belief. So say it without fear. Otherwise, at the very least acknowledge and respect that it's there, integrate and test it."

    "definition": "A broad range of friends gives a broad range of perspectives. Age, culture, gender, sexual preferences."

  },
  {
    "definition": "Don’t prove yourself. Live by your own values and don't attach yourself to your frame. If how you seem is rotten to one person or group, it's almost certainly great to someone else."

    "definition": "Nothing wrong with feeling painful or grand emotions. You're a passionate person"
  },
  {
    "definition": "Too much emphasis on how much: how many records does this DJ own; how many books have you read on this or that subject. Reading one book, or listening to one record and dedicating time to it is better. I don't need to see and hear it all, if it means sacrificing the depth of understanding. No one likes a mr or miss know it all who's always putting their hand up."

    "definition": "Rungs on ladders: steadily climbing; tearfully slipping; anxiously clinging. At the top, I'd 'make it' - but make what? A loft conversion, an IKEA showroom filled with browsers: love only for my finances; friends only of my successes. Let go of this ladder to heaven, legs unbroken."

    "definition": "I am superficial. Someone with a new flashy job feels impressive to me. If I found out you were famous, I would look at you different. I am also a reverse snob, I despise myself and others for not treating people as equals. Both are extreme, so try to be in the middle. Playfully superficial."
