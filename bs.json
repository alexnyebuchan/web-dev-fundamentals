    "definition": "Making music is a great way to spend your time, no matter your current state of employment. However, without a life outside of your creations, the music will probably be boring. What you channel into music - work, love, life stories or otherwise - is what makes it interesting."
  },
  {
    "definition": "I don’t care what age my friends are. Why would I hang out with someone my own age I don’t like, rather than someone younger or older that I do? I like a broad range of perspectives."

    "definition": "Frame Justifying: trying to mitigate or explain why your status is better than it looks, anxiously. A form of reframing. Eg. ‘I work in hospitality but I’m an Assistant General Manager with a salary.’ Eg. ‘I’m a rich kid but I’ve made my own way and had no help. Self made man.’ We try to cover up low status chips to our frame. This only comes across as insecure. Be honest and direct. ‘I have some wealth, I pursued my passion in my 20s. Who wouldn’t?’. No reframing."

    "definition": "Accolades and achievements are seductive for your self worth. It's tempting to fall back on these in hard times ‘well at least I did x, y or z’ - but take with a pinch of salt. Same with attaching negative self esteem to bad past experiences ‘I fucked up a, b or c’. Allow the little buzz or sting from either, but don't let it consume"

  },
  {
    "definition": "To me, a loser is someone who lives by a set of values not their own, not taking risks, confronting themselves in order to grow. In order to know your values however, you may need to go through phases of being a “loser”, be tested, to realize what your values even are. It's ok to have a bumpy ride, we're all losers sometimes."

  },
  {
    "definition": "Too much emphasis on quantity: how many records does this DJ own; how many books have you read on this or that subject. I don't need to see and hear it all, if it means sacrificing the depth of understanding from listening to the same thing multiple times. No one likes a mr or miss know it all who's always putting their hand up."

    "definition": "What if we took all appearances about two people you know, everything about them as objects in the real world including job, attractiveness, health etc. and swappped them, same people underneath, theoretically. What's left underneath both, do they deserve equal respect?"
  },
  {
    "definition": "Rungs on ladders: steadily climbing; tearfully slipping; anxiously clinging. At the top, I'd 'make it' - but make what? A loft conversion, an IKEA showroom filled with browsers: love only for my finances; friends only of my successes. If you let go of this ladder to heaven, you'll be surprised when you're legs don't break."

    "definition": "Approach potential lovers with curiosity"
